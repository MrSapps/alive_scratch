1
00:00:00,662 --> 00:00:04,600
We're screwed! Pants, pants, some pants, pants!

2
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:10,257
It's not fair!

3
00:00:10,474 --> 00:00:13,205
We had twice ze flavor.

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,537
[Screams of agony]

5
00:00:23,702 --> 00:00:26,451
I got out of there just in time.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,971
And I got the usual reception.

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,605
Abe! Abe! It's Abe! It's Abey!

8
00:00:33,697 --> 00:00:35,600
It's Abe! It's that Abe guy!

9
00:00:37,834 --> 00:00:40,857
The Mudokons were slowly coming together.

10
00:00:41,657 --> 00:00:45,177
And they were using using their skills to build something new.

11
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:45,971
Ah!

12
00:00:46,771 --> 00:00:48,097
D'oww!

13
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:50,617
That gotta hurt!

14
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:56,102
You'll be fine. Get along would ya.

15
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,560
See it's all feeling better already.

16
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,811
Hello, my name is Alf.

17
00:01:00,057 --> 00:01:00,988
Hi Alf!

18
00:01:01,017 --> 00:01:03,137
I had my first brew

19
00:01:03,748 --> 00:01:06,291
while I was with Abe in the desert.

20
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:08,411
Well....

21
00:01:08,554 --> 00:01:11,760
They were taking things one step at a time.

22
00:01:11,897 --> 00:01:12,931
Can I share now?

23
00:01:12,931 --> 00:01:13,320
No, just shut up!
Can I share now?

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,840
No, just shut up!

25
00:01:15,565 --> 00:01:17,211
All was going well.

26
00:01:20,628 --> 00:01:23,765
But we knew, there had to be more of us out there.

27
00:01:25,514 --> 00:01:26,925
We're screwed...

28
00:01:32,365 --> 00:01:34,891
And we're gonna find them!

29
00:01:55,714 --> 00:02:00,085
We interrupt this program to bring you this special news bulletin.

30

32
00:02:06,514 --> 00:02:10,051

33
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,937
