1
00:00:09,302 --> 00:00:11,668
<i>Abe, you made it!</i>

2
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:14,937
Guys, uh, Weirdos, uh, whatever you are!

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,228
Did you know that the Glukkons are using your bones to make SoulStorm Brew?

4
00:00:19,565 --> 00:00:21,234
<i>Of course we do!</i>

5
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:23,765
<i>That's why we need you.</i>

6
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:25,891
What can I do?

7
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,177
<i>You shut down RuptureFarms.</i>

8
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:31,457
<i>You can shut down the Brewery too!</i>

9
00:00:31,457 --> 00:00:34,228
You want me to shut down SoulStorm Brewery?

10
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:36,114
Okay, I'm afraid.

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:39,571
<i>Don't worry, we can give you power.</i>

12
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:43,245
<i>Yeah, spirit powers!</i>

13
00:00:43,257 --> 00:00:44,017
<i>Yeah!</i>

14
00:00:44,325 --> 00:00:46,497
You sure about- [Sounds of pain]

15
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:50,154
I've been through this before.

16
00:00:50,725 --> 00:00:54,011
Back when I got the power to shut down RuptureFarms.

17
00:00:56,434 --> 00:01:00,662
That's when I first saw the creatures of Oddworld as they used to be.

18
00:01:01,308 --> 00:01:04,182
Before we chopped them into Tasty Treats.

19
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:06,880
We had forgotten our past...

20
00:01:07,417 --> 00:01:10,057
and now it was costing us our future....

21
00:01:13,777 --> 00:01:16,668
and even our souls.
Come on up!

22
00:01:16,937 --> 00:01:18,331
New and improved!

23
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,840
Wha-what is it?

24
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,622
Don't think, DRINK!

25
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,222
Umm... I...

26
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,948
Ah, come on. Do it!

27
00:01:28,474 --> 00:01:29,045
Ok!

28
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,834
[Wild gulps]

29
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:36,108
At first the Glukkons gave their brew away.

30
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:38,954
Oh, tasty!

31
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,382
But once the Mudokons started drinking it,

32
00:01:43,382 --> 00:01:45,380
they couldn't stop!

33
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:49,748
Then those Glukkons told them that if they wanted to work

34
00:01:50,177 --> 00:01:52,502
they could have all the brew they wanted.

35
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,891
Only if you got a job!

36
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:55,085
They fell for it.

37
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,280
Step right up!

38
00:01:56,337 --> 00:01:57,154
Ow!

39
00:01:57,154 --> 00:01:59,150
I love this job, hehehe!

40
00:02:00,611 --> 00:02:01,914
Step right up!

41
00:02:02,297 --> 00:02:05,982
So now the Weirdos want me to destroy the Brewery,

42
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,834
but I gotta save the Mudokons there first.

43
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:15,708
And I just got the power to heal Mudokons sick from brew.
